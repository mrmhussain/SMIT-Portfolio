    <p style="width: 300px; margin-top: -260px; margin-left: 300px;">The markhor is the national animal of Pakistan, where it is also known (in English) as the "screw-horn" or screw-horned goat.[3] The word mārkhor (مارخور), meaning "snake-eater", comes from both Urdu and classical Persian languages, referencing the ancient belief that the markhor would actively kill and consume snakes.[4] This regional myth is believed to stem from the "snake-like" form of the male markhor's horns, twisting and curling like a snake, possibly leading ancient peoples to associate them with snakes.</p>
